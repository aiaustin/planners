# planners - Artificial Intelligence Planning Systems

A repository of AI planning systems from the work of Prof. Austin Tate and his Planning and Activity research group at the University of Edinburgh in the Artificial Intelligence and its Applications Institute (AIAI) - previously the Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute (1984-2019).

## Traverser: (1971-2)
Traverser (also called Graph Traverser 4 - GT4) was created during 1971-1972 in an undergraduate student project in Computer Studies at the University of Lancaster. It built on the work of Donald Michie and his colleagues at the Department of Machine Intelligence and Perception at the University of Edinburgh.

## Interplan: (1972-74)
An early planning system whose search was directed by finding and debugging "approaches" that handled the goal structure underlying the problem. Interplan was created in 1972-1975 as part of Austin Tate's PhD, supervised by Professor Donald Michie at the Machine Intelligence Research Unit at the University of Edinburgh.

## Nonlin: (1974-82)
The original hierarchical task network, partial-order planner - used as the basis for text book descriptions of this type of technology (Russell & Norvig). Nonlin was created in 1975-1976 during the first year of the UK Science Research Council project entitled "Planning: a joint AI/OR Approach" whose Principal Investigator was Professor Bernard Meltzer. Lesley Daniel was the Operational Research researcher on the project. Nonlin continued to be developed in the 1982-3 period in joint work with Steve Vere at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (who created the DEVISER planner), and with Andrew Whiter at Systems Designers Ltd in the UK. Brian Drabble's Excalibur planner built on Nonlin by adding a qualitative process reasoner.

## O-Plan: (1983-99)
An AI planning , execution and plan repair system with extensive representations for temporal, resource and other constraints, support for plan execution monitoring and plan repair "on-the-fly". Runable as a web service. Written in Common Lisp with User Interface and Web Service eements in Java.

## I-X: (2000-present)
A portable cross-platform Java-based planning and collaboration support environment. Aid to multi-agent cooperative work and external services use. Based on the <I-N-C-A> conceptual model.
