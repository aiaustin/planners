Instructions for the O-Plan 3.3 release
---------------------------------------

O-Plan 3.3 is distributed as a gzipped tar file containing some
documentation, some example domain definitions, and complete
source code.

To use this system,

 1. Get a copy of the file oplan-3.3-25May00.tar.gz via

      http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~oplan/release/

 2. Make a (new) directory to contain the O-Plan files and
    unpack the release tar file there, e.g. as follows:

      zcat oplan-3.3-25May00.tar.gz | tar xpf -

 3. Follow the instructions in the INSTALL file.

You will need a machine running a suitable version of Unix and a
Common Lisp system for that machine.  Recent versions of O-Plan have
been successfully used with the following combinations:

  Machine      Operating system       Common Lisps
  -------      ----------------       ------------
  Sun SPARC    SunOS 4.1.3            Lucid 4.1,
                                      Allegro 4.3,
                                      GCL-1.1

  Sun SPARC    SunOS 5.1.1 (Solaris)  Liquid 5.0.3,
                                      Lucid 4.4.1,
                                      Allegro 4.3 and 5.0,
                                      GCL-2.2.2 and -2.3 (modified)

  386 etc PC   FreeBSD                GCL-1.1, -2.2.2, and -2.3

  386 etc PC   Linux Redhat 5.2       GCL-2.3 (modified)

The "modified" in connection with GCL is because some additional
routines must be linked in when GCL is built for certain operating
systems.  For instructions on how to do this, mail to oplan@aiai.ed.ac.uk.

A version of O-Plan prebuilt using GCL (GNU Common Lisp) is also
available.  Since that version is already in executable form, you
do not need any separate Lisp system in order to use it.  The prebuilt
O-Plan can be obtained via http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~oplan/release/.
