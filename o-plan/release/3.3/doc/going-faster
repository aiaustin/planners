Going faster
------------
There are times when you'll want to run O-Plan as quickly as possible,
or at least to speed it up.  Here we describe the steps to take.

It turns out that much of O-Plan's time is spent producing "tracing"
output of various sorts as it runs.  Each component (IM, AM, etc) has
a window in which it prints descriptions of significant events as
thet occur, and then there's the list of running processes (the 
"run lights") and the "whats-going-on" file.  The "whats-going-on"
file is used only by developers and is off by default, but the
running process display and the component output are normally on,
and each accounts for roughly a factor of 2 in run-time.

Yes, that's right: O-Plan will run about 4 times faster if you turn
them off.

 * To turn off the trace / debug output, using the control panel
   to set the "Diagnostic Level" to "Nothing" in all components.

 * To turn off the "run lights", evaluate (run-lights-off) by typing
   it in the Lisp-interaction window (which is normally the window
   you used to run O-Plan).

 * In KCL, also evaluate (use-fast-links t).

All of the above can be done by evaluating (go-faster).
