O-Plan source documentation
----------------------------
This directory contains documentation for aspects of O-Plan that are
not necessarily described, or described in such detail, or described
in the same way, in the formatted, paper documentation.

There are two main kinds of files here: LaTeX sources and plain text.
In the plain text especially, something like

   See the "A b c" section.

is a pointer to the file "a-b-c" or "a-b-c.tex" (whichever exists)
in this directory.  For instance, `See the "TA interface" section"'
is a reference to the file "ta-interface".

What follows is a brief guide to some starting points.


Using O-Plan
-------------

command-line-arguments

   Describes the syntax of the "oplan" command (which is used for
   running O-Plan).

parameters

   Describes parameters that affect the operation of O-Plan and
   whose values can be set by command-line arguments or by commands
   in your "oplan-init" file.

ta-interface

   This is the document to read if you wish to run and then control
   O-Plan from a separate program or wish to define a new interface
   to O-Plan.  It describes the messages to and from O-Plan in O-Plan's
   "task-assignment interface" and the Lisp procedures in the higher-level
   "program interface"; it provides detailed instructions on how to run
   O-Plan in "connect" and "subroutine" modes (which correspond to the
   "-connect" and "-subr" command-line arguments, respectively); and
   it includes a range of examples.   

ta-interface-quick-reference

   Presents information from "ta-interface" in summary form.

tf-syntax-checking

   Describes how to run O-Plan as a TF syntax-checker.
