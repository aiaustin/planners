Instructions for the O-Plan 3.1 release
---------------------------------------

O-Plan 3.1 is distributed as a gzipped tar file containing documentation,
some example domain definitions, and source code.

You will need Lucid Common Lisp (LCL) version 4.1 with CLOS and a
Sun4 running version 4.1.3 of SunOS.  The system should also work under
Solaris, although Solaris seems to create problems for the windows
O-Plan creates when it starts up.  If lines printed in those windows
fail to end in newlines, and text therefore marches ever further to
the right, then you are experiencing that problem.  The problem will
be fixed at some point, but for now it remains.  However, apart from
that, O-Plan will still run correctly.

A version of O-Plan prebuilt using KCL (actually GNU Common Lisp 1.1)
is also available, if you do not have Lucid CL.  Since that version is
already in executable form, you do not need any Lisp system in order
to use it.

To use the ordinary release, which does need Lucid Common Lisp, you
will need to

 1. Get a copy of the file oplan-3.1-31Jan97.tar.gz via

      http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~oplan/release/

 2. Make a (new) directory to contain the O-Plan files and
    unpack the release tar file there, e.g. as follows:

      zcat oplan-3.1-31Jan97.tar.gz | tar xpf -

 3. Follow the instructions in the INSTALL file.
