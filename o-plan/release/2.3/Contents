O-Plan is a prototype system to support the description of planning
domains, tasks and plans to carry out those tasks.  It has a sample
user interface and includes a simple execution system.

O-Plan documents in this directory are in UNIX compressed file (.Z)
PostScript format.  After using uncompress on files with .Z suffixes, you
should be able to print these to a PostScript printer.

Some users with Apple printers have reported problems with loss of the
edges of the text.  If this occurs, it is wise to reset the printer
before trying to re-print again. Some of the documents contain large
bit map images which can take some time to print -- please be patient.
If printing problem persists please advise the O-Plan team (email:
oplan@ed.ac.uk).

The full O-Plan distribution is available for use within the ARPI
for those with appropriate authority.

When unpacking the tar image, permissions on files should be preserved.
This can be done by including the "p" flag in the tar command.

As well as using the Installation Manual, look at the RELEASE-NOTES and
source/INSTALL files within the release for useful information about the
release and its installation.

oplan-<version>.tar.Z
------------------------

oplan-status.ps.Z       A description of the status of the current release.
                         This file is NOT part of the release itself, so it
                         should be obtained to explain any variances from
                         specification or known bugs in the current release.

Other documents described below are available in Latex source format in the
documentation directories of the release image itself, but it may be
convenient to obtain PostScript copies directly from this server.

------------------------

The installation guide in particular should be read before trying to make use
of the O-Plan tar image.

The following two documents provide a detailed description of the
O-Plan system and are suitable introductions for those interested in
the system and what it offers, but who are not necessarily interested
in the code itself.

distributed O-Plan release image.
