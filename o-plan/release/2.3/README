                       AutoCAD Demonstration Files
                       ---------------------------

This directory contains the Demonstration AutoCAD files for use with
O-Plan.  The files are as follows:

1. acad-plan.config
                a file used with xrdb to set up suitable windows sizes
                for AutoCAD - suitable for the Plan Viewer.

2. acad-world.config
                a file used with xrdb to set up suitable windows sizes
                for AutoCAD - suitable for the World Viewer.

3. startup.lsp  file copied to acad.lsp in current directory by startup
                scripts oplan-acad-plan-view and oplan-acad-world-view
                This causes a <name>.lsp file to be loaded based on the
                drawing name used.

4. plan.*       files needed for the Default Plan Viewer (.dwg  .lsp  .mnu)

5. plan-parts.dwg
                used to build the root drawing for plan.dwg (visible
                components used to make drawing blocks in AutoCAD).

6. world.*      files needed for the Default World Viewer (.dwg  .lsp  .mnu)

7. space-platform.*
                files needed for a World Viewer (.dwg  .lsp  .mnu  .scr  .sld)

8. map-view.*
                files needed for a World Viewer (.dwg  .lsp  .mnu  .scr  .sld)

9. map-view-parts.dwg
                used to build the root drawing for map-view.dwg (visible
                components used to make drawing blocks in AutoCAD).


For each drawing name files with other suffixes may be created in this
directory when AutoCAD runs (.mnx  and temporarily  .dwk   .mnk).

The demonstrations, files, etc are further defined in AIAI-TR-76
"Interfacing a CAD System to an AI Planner", A.Tate, January 1990.
