This page supports O-Plan releases by providing some advice on
Frequently Asked Questions. Note that instructions for obtaining
and installing O-Plan are provided via the main
<a href="index.html">O-Plan Release Page</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>When I run O-Plan, why do I get a message "Warning: No
OPLANTMPDIR; using current directory"?</b>

<p>O-Plan looks for an environment variable OPLANTMPDIR to use as the
directory for temporary files.  If no variable is specifically set,
O-Plan will use the current directory you are in when you start
O-Plan.
<p>

<li><b>When I run O-Plan in its web-server (HTTP) mode, why do I get an
error message saying it cannot create a file?</b>

<p>When O-Plan is run in HTTP mode, it creates a log file in which
it records information about each HTTP request.  Part of the O-Plan
installation procedure is to create a directory to contain the log
files.  This directory is not provided automatically to ensure that you
are made aware that it exists and can determine its location.
The most likely source of your problem is either that the
log file directory does not exist or that it does not grant you
write permission.

<p>Create a directory called "web-tmp" at the top level of the directory
in which you installed O-Plan, and make it writable by everyone who will be
using O-Plan.  If you would like the directory to be in a different
place, change the symbolic link source/web/demo/tmp.<p>

<p>See the file <a href="3.3/doc/http-mode">source/doc/http-mode</a>
for instructions on using O-Plan in HTTP mode.
<p>

<li><b>Can you give me a simple script to run O-Plan?</b>

<p>O-Plan should be installed in such a way that "oplan" can be
used as a shell command that invokes the "oplan" script provided
by the O-Plan distribution.

<p>If there are some combinations of command-line arguments that you
repeatedly use, a convenient way to avoid specifying them each time is
to create a short shell script that supplies them automatically while
still allowing other parameters to be specified on the command line.
For example:

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
exec oplan -http -browser netscape -domain house-4 "$@"
</pre>

<p>The <tt>"$@"</tt> is used to pass along any command-line arguments
given when the script is run.

<p>For further examples, see the files
<a href="3.3/doc/ta-interface">source/doc/ta-interface</a>
and <a href="3.3/doc/http-mode">source/doc/http-mode</a>.
<p>


<li><b>What is a good demonstration setup for O-Plan on a laptop?</b>

<p>You can get a a stand-alone O-Plan planning system with a Web
interface by running O-Plan in its HTTP server mode (see the file <a
href="3.3/doc/http-mode">source/doc/http-mode</a>).  This provides
an HTML interface to the planner in a form suitable for use with
a Web browser.   When O-Plan has successfully started in HTTP
mode, it prints a URL.  You can then direct a browser to that URL.
<p>

<li><b>How can I get <tt>foreach</tt> to work with anything but an
explicit set?  For example i would like to have a team move schema
that would move each member of the team, where the particular team is
given by a variable of the schema.</b>

<p>The <a href="3.3/tf-manual.ps">Task Formalism Manual</a> (pages 51-52)
explains that iteration sets are expanded while planning and hence
may be read from an external source or instantiated through variables.
However, the values of all variables involved must be known at the
time the schema containing the iteration is selected for expansion.
For a fuller explanation of the issues involved, plus examples,
see <a href="faq/iterated-nodes-and-variables.html"
>faq/iterated-nodes-and-variables.html</a>.

<li><b>When I run O-Plan, why do I get an error message that says
"error stat'ing /dev/ttydirs/xxx/xxxxxxxxxxxxp1: No such file or
directory"?</b>

<p>The error message is written by "xterm" when O-Plan runs it to
create a window.  This happens on some Linux installations, but not
on others, and there does not appear to be any effect on how the
windows work after they've appeared.
