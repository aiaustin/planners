                  Austin Tate's Nonlin planning system
                  ------------------------------------

The influential Nonlin hierarchical partial order planning system,
developed by Austin Tate (http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~bat/bat.html)
in the University of Edinburgh is available in a browsable and
downloadable form here:

    Austin Tate's Nonlin Planning System

Nonlin is released as is for academic and research purposes.  It is a
research prototype created in the mid 1970s and released to people
interested in experimenting with an early AI planner.

Nonlin is subject to the same copyright notice as the Poplog copyright
notice:
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/copyright.html

I.e. you can use, copy, alter these files, and re-distribute them, but
you do so at your own risk. Neither the author nor the University
of Birmingham, which hosts the Free Poplog web site
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html
is responsible in any way. Both make no warranties of any sort.

Austin put a lot of effort into making it run as it used to in a much
earlier version of Poplog, so that it works in both Windows poplog and
Linux/Unix poplog.

Fetch the file
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/nonlin/nonlin-2002-11-28.zip

unzip it. E.g. if you unzip it in the $poplocal/local/ directory
it will create a directory

    $poplocal/local/nonlin/

containing instructions, a nonlin sub-directory with code and examples,
and a load_nonlin.p file, used to start nonlin interactively in pop11.

Note that at present the package works only with a normal terminal
interface: it has not been converted to be run from inside Ved or XVed,
so there is no point trying to compile it in Ved.

(If anyone alters it to work with Ved so that a task can be specified
in a Ved buffer and Nonlin run from Ved, please submit your changes
to the Poplog repository.)

Instructions and historical information regarding Nonlin, including a
review of the package, are in the file:
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/nonlin/readme.txt

A version formatted for Windows users is here:
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/nonlin/readme-win.txt

Further information, including sample problem domain definitions using
the Nonlin task formalism (TF) can be found in these directories:

Nonlin is also available in Edinburgh here:
    http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/project/nonlin/

The original 1976 technical report defining Nonlin has been scanned in
and is now available as a PDF file (6.75Mbytes) at both the Edinburgh
and Birmingham sites.
