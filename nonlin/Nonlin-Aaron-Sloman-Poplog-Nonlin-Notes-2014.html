Austin Tate's Nonlin planning system
------------------------------------</b>

The influential Nonlin hierarchical partial order planning system,
developed by Austin Tate (<a href="http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~bat/">http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~bat/</a>) in the
University of Edinburgh is available in a browsable and
downloadable form here (this web site):

    Austin Tate's Nonlin Planning System

<b>NOTE ADDED: 30 Jan 2014</b>
The nonlin package is demonstrated in the Coursera online course on

    Artificial Intelligence Planning
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/aiplan">https://www.coursera.org/course/aiplan</a>

    Presented by
    Gerhard Wickler, The University of Edinburgh
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/gwickler">https://www.coursera.org/instructor/gwickler</a>
    and
    Austin Tate, The University of Edinburgh
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/austintate">https://www.coursera.org/instructor/austintate</a>

Students registered on that course, or anyone else, wanting to run
the nonlin planner can either install linux poplog, as recommended here:

    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/latest-poplog">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/latest-poplog</a>

or install windows poplog, as recommended here:

    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/winpop">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/winpop</a>
        (The information here may be out of date, as I am not a windows
        user!)

There is a mailing list that can be used to ask for help on poplog or pop11

     <a href="https://mailman.cs.bham.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/pop-forum">https://mailman.cs.bham.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/pop-forum</a>

 and another for anyone interested in poplog development or ports:

<b>Running Nonlin</b>

Austin put a lot of effort into making nonlin run as it used to in a much
earlier version of Poplog, so that it works in both Windows poplog and
Linux/Unix poplog.

He has produced a video demo of the nonlin planner in use, which you should
be able to copy if you have installed either windows poplog or linux poplog.
The video is here:

    methods.

<a name="instructions"><b>TO RUN NONLIN</b></a>

After installing poplog, fetch the file

    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/nonlin/nonlin-2002-11-28.zip">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/nonlin/nonlin-2002-11-28.zip</a>

unzip it. E.g. if you unzip it in the $poplocal/local/ directory
it will create a directory

    $poplocal/local/nonlin/

containing instructions, a nonlin sub-directory with code and examples,
and a load_nonlin.p file, used to start nonlin interactively in pop11.

Note that at present the package works only with a normal terminal
interface: it has not been converted to be run from inside Ved or XVed,
so there is no point trying to compile it in Ved.

(If anyone alters it to work with Ved so that a task can be specified
in a Ved buffer and Nonlin run from Ved, please submit your changes
to the Poplog repository via <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs">Aaron Sloman</a>.)

Nonlin is also available in Edinburgh here:

The original 1976 technical report defining Nonlin has been scanned in
and is now available as a PDF file (6.75Mbytes) at both the Edinburgh
and Birmingham sites.

<b>Conditions of use</b>
Nonlin is released as is for academic and research purposes.  It is a
research prototype created in the mid 1970s and released to people
interested in experimenting with an early AI planner.

notice:
