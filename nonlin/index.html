<H2>Austin Tate's Nonlin Planning System</H2>

The Nonlin hierarchical partial-order AI planning system, developed by
<a href="http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~bat/">Austin Tate</a> at the
University of Edinburgh, is available in a downloadable
form here: <a href="./">http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/project/nonlin/</a>, a
browsable from here: <a href="./nonlin/">here</a> or
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/nonlin">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/nonlin</a>
thanks to Aaron Sloman at the University of Birmingham for encouraging
Austin to make it it run as it used to in a much earlier version of
Poplog, so that it works in both Windows Poplog and Linux/Unix Poplog.
<P>

Get a copy of the freely distributable version of Poplog at
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html</a>
[PC/Windows version 15.5 is available locally <a href="./poplog/">here</a> -
note this version is only for a 32 bit Windows OS].
Unpack the files to a temporary location and run "SETUP.EXE". It may
be best to allow the installer to place the files in the default
sugegsted position to avoid any problems with spaces in directory
names. You can then run Poplog POP-11 in a Window
via the "Pop-11" shortcut created.

<P>

Fetch the <a href="nonlin.zip">nonlin.zip file</a> and unzip it in
<!--
the $poplocal/local/ directory (likely to be C:\users\&lt;your-user-name&gt;)
or
-->
any directory you wish to use to try it out.

<h3>Documentation</h3>

Some information on getting Nonlin
up and running in recent versions of Poplog are in the
<a href="./nonlin/readme.txt">readme.txt</a>. Help to run the program is
available in the <a href="./nonlin/nonlin/nonlintxt">on-line instructions</a>.
Further information, including sample problem domain definitions using
the Nonlin task formalism (TF) can be found in the release zip file or
can be browsed on-line <a href="./nonlin/">here</a>.
A short video demonstration of Nonlin is available
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF3s_Nb_FyE">here</a>.

<h3>UM Nonlin</h3>

The University of Maryland produced a Common Lisp version of some
core parts of the Nonlin planner incorporating its hierarchical
partial order approach to planning.  See
<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/plus/Nonlin/">http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/plus/Nonlin/</a>
for more details and to download that version.

<h3><a name="excalibur">Excalibur</a></h3>

Brian Drabble's Ph.D project Excalibur planner was based on Nonlin and
linked HTN planning methods with qualitative process reasoning.
