Nonlin Alert

        Version for Poplog 15.5 and onwards.

        Note that there is an error in the CPM package when used with
        domains including a schema with over 20 nodes.  This has not
        been investigated yet.  Either use Nonlin without the CPM package
        (e.g. for the "space" domain) or use schemas with less than 20 nodes.
