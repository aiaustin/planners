Subject: MOOC, Nonlin, Poplog

I thought you might be interested to know that someone who is on the MOOC decided
to explore Poplog. He managed to get an old 64 bit version of poplog partially
running on 64-bit gentoo, and wrote to tell me.


I have advised him that the 64 bit poplog has not been maintained and will probably
not work properly and that it's better to install 32 bit poplog on 64 bit linux (if
you don't need 64-bit integers, pointers, etc.)


I still have your old version of nonlin here:


        http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/nonlin/


If you have a newer version I'll be happy to install it.


I did once start trying to convert the demos to work inside Ved (or XVed), which
would make interaction more comfortable, but it turned out to be a much more
complex task than I had anticipated, though I can't remember why!


Probably because the nonlin demos interacted with low level xterm mechanisms
which would have to be emulated in Ved or replaced with Ved mechanisms?


If anyone asks explicitly about getting and using poplog you can try pointing them
at my (very amateurish) collection of video tutorials, all unscripted and messy.

That includes a demo of me installing poplog on fedora, which an experienced
linux user may be able to generalise to other versions of linux, though
there are now get-and-install scripts for fedora, ubuntu and arch linux
(though I've only tested the fedora one on both 32bit and 64bit fedora,
and the ubuntu script on 32 bit ubuntu):

        (tested by a couple of Arch users, but not recently)


http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/latest-poplog/get-fedora-poplog


http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/latest-poplog/get-ubuntu-poplog


They all install libraries for their systems, then fetch and run this one:


http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/latest-poplog/get-and-install-v15.65-poplog


So the last script can be used by knowledgable users of other versions of linux
who look at the get-X-poplog scripts and generalise.


Poplog Mailing Lists

For Poplog users there is an old-style email forum anyone can join
which can be used to ask for help:


    https://mailman.cs.bham.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/pop-forum


and another for anyone interested in poplog development

PS
I've tried, and failed, to find an ARM expert who might be interested in porting
Poplog to ARM+linux, so that it can run on a Raspberry Pi. I expect it would be
a significant addition to the other teaching materials being developed and it
is very non-resource-hungry for what it provides, having previously been developed
and used for teaching on machines with much less memory and cpu power !
Suggestions welcome, if you know someone. I would be willing to help, but I can't
do it myself. Someone did suggest first porting it to a machine-independent VM
(I forget the name of the package) and then using that but I am pretty sure that
will take much longer because of the difficulties of making a truly machine
independent VM that supports everything necessary on each physical machine.
After all, that's what the core of poplog does for the rest of poplog.
