I-X Support for OWL-S
</H3>

<P>
You can add I-X support for OWL-S using files available in an add-on
distribution.  This contains the files needed to use I-X with the
OWL-S API - 
<a href="http://www.mindswap.org/2004/owl-s/api/">http://www.mindswap.org/2004/owl-s/api/</a>.
<P>

</P>
Unzip the OWL-s add-on file, which will be called something like
"ix-<i>version</i>-owl-s.zip", in the directory in which
you installed I-X.
<P>

</P>
Before going further, you may wish to save your existing ix.jar and
imports/all-imports.jar because they are replaced to allow the use
of OWL-S.
<P>

</P>
Then use etc/ix-with-owl-s.jar to replace ix.jar (move or rename) and
etc/all-imports-for-owl-s.jar to replace imports/all-imports.jar.
<P>

</P>
Check that imports/owl-s exists and contains a fair number
of jar files.
<P>

</P>
Note that we are not distributing the file upnp100.jar that is
part of the OWL-S 1.0.0 API, because of licencing issues.
It is not needed for any existing I-X applications.
