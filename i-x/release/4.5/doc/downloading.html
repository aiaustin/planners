<p>From this page the complete current public release of the I-X
software can be downloaded. The release includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>the complete I-X system (Java classes to run in a JRE)</li>

<li>the complete documentation including examples</li>

<li>some project-specific application packages</li>

<li>the full software licence</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the public release does not include the source code.</p>
<p>Note also that to run I-X, <a href="#java">Java</a> needs to be 
installed on your machine.

<p>I-X is Copyright (C) 2000 - 2008, AIAI, The University of Edinburgh</p>

<p>I-X is distributed under an open source licence.
Read the <a href="../doc/ix-licence.html">full licence</a> for details.</p>

<h2><a id="instructions" name="instructions">Instructions for
Downloading and Installing I-X</a></h2>

<p>Downloading and installing I-X consists of three major
steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Download the zip-file</b>: Go to the <a href="#release">public
release section</a> below and press the download button. The file that
must be downloaded is called something like "<code>ix-core.zip</code>"
or "<code>ix-</code><i>N</i><code>-core.zip</code>", where <i>N</i> is
the latest version number (e.g. the I-X version 4.2 is called
"<code>ix-4.2-core.zip</code>"). Your browser should then bring up a
window asking you what you want to do with this file type
(<code>".zip"</code>). The best way to proceed is to save the file
somewhere on your computer (remember where!).</li>

<li><b>Unpack the zip-file</b>: Unzip the I-X core. The exact
method for doing this depends on the operating system you are
using. For instance, under Windows, you can unzip the core using a
tool such as Winzip. For example, if you unzip the core into the D
drive, this will generate the "<code>D:\ix-4.2\...</code>"
directory. Under Unix, you can use the <code>unzip</code>-command
to unzip the file to a location of your choosing. In the
documentation, we use the term <i>base directory</i>, or
<code>&lt;ix-base&gt;</code>, to refer to this directory.</li>

<li><b>Run the test-script</b>: If you use Windows, go to the
directory "&lt;ix-base&gt;/scripts/win/" and run the script called
"<code>test-setup.bat</code>". This should produce a few lines of
output, essentially telling you which version of Java is being
used. Unless one of the lines reads "'java' is not recognized as an
internal or external command, operable program or batch file.", it
should be fine. Currently there is no equivalent script for Unix or
other operating systems, but a simple "<code>java -version</code>"
should at least tell you whether a JRE can be found in your
environment.</li>
</ol>

<p>I-X is now successfully installed on your machine. (For a quick
look at an I-X Process Panel, double-click on the <a
href="../ix.jar">I-X Jar File</a> at &lt;ix-base&gt;/ix.jar.)</p>

<!--
<p><i><font color="red">If we had an applet version of I-X we could
model this process and have the user use I-X for the first time
while installing I-X (optionally).</font></i></p>

<h2><a id="release" name="release">The I-X Public Release</a></h2>

<form
action="http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/project/ix/release/current/">
<div align="center"><input type="submit"
value="Download I-X (current version)" /></div>
</form>

<h2><a id="java" name="java">Java</a></h2>

<p>Since it is written in the Java programming language, to use I-X
you will need to have a Java runtime system (the Java Virtual Machine
(JVM)) installed on your computer, and its location specified in the
value of your path environment variable.  (To test whether you have a
JVM installed, type "java" at command-line prompt - if it is correctly
installed this should return a message about how to use Java.) </p>

<p>If you need to install Java, you should download the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) which contains the JVM. If you intend to do any Java
development, download the Java Software Development Kit (SDK) instead
- in addition to the JVM this also contains a Java compiler and
debugger, useful if you then go on to develop code to extend the I-X
system for your own applications. Both JRE and SDK are available from
<a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>. Alternatively,
ask your local computing support staff - they should be able to help
you install and run a JVM.
</p>

<h2><a id="support" name="support">Support</a></h2>

<p>Currently, the support for I-X is rather limited. In the first
instance, you should consult the documentation that is part of the
public release version (see "&lt;ix-base&gt;/doc/"). If this does
not answer all your questions, try the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="index.html">online documentation</a> is
identical to what is provided in the current public release.</li>
